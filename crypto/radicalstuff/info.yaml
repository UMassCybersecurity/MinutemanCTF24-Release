description: As it turns out, encrypting identical messages with RSA is not usually a good idea... Use Chinese Remainder Theorem to reconstruct the message before modulus operations, then take its 257th root to recover the flag!

flags:
  - content: MINUTEMAN{modern_rsa_inserts_extra_noise_for_each_encryption_to_avoid_this}

hints:
  - content: To use Chinese Remainder Theorem, you need the moduli (plural of modulus) and corresponding remainders
  - content: Modify the given cube root function to take the 257th root instead, and don't forget to adjust the range!
