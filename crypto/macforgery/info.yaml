description: Using a secret RSA key, our custom MAC algorithm produces a signature and a tag to verify authenticity and integrity. Except this only works if the signature cannot be forged.

flags:
  - content: MINUTEMAN{hash_the_message_and_signing_that_instead_and_add_more_interdependence}

hints:
  - content: There are certain numbers whose powers are known even if you don't know the exponent used.
  - content: As long as your message starts with 'give_flag' followed by a comma, the server will print the flag for you.

value: 400

tags:
  - chosen-plaintext
