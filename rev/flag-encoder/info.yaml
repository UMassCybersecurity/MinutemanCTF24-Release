name: Flag Encoder
description: I've encoded my flag with a never seen before encoding algorithm. Surely nobody will be able to break it, right?

flags:
  - content: "MINUTEMAN{R3v3r53_7H3_5cr1P7}"

hints:
  - content: "Try to figure out what each line is doing individually."
  - content: "You can get back the input by undoing each step in the script in reverse order."
