# Hints are used to give players a way to buy or have suggestions. They are not required but can be nice.
hints:
- content: search up `docker run container from dockerfile`
- content: "You will have to build the container before running it. You can check what images you have built with `docker images`."
- content: "You will need to run `docker run <image-id>` to run the container." 
- content: "You will need to pass through the port for http (port 80) with `docker run <image-id> -p [host-port]:[container-port]`."
- content: "Once the container is running with the port passed through, go to `http://127.0.0.1`."
