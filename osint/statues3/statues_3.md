"I was going to take a picture but the statue got cut off. Can you tell me the last line on the plate below the statue?"

Flag format: `UMASS{FIRST_TWO_LINES_ALL_CAPS}` eg https://www.umass.edu/physicalplant/sites/default/files/IMG_1409.jpg is `UMASS{METAWAMPE_LEGENDARY_SPIRIT_OF_THE_REDMEN}`

flag: `UMASS{DEDICATED_TO_ALL_IRISH_GUARDSMEN}`

Solve:
look up the locations on the sign (first one shows windsor is city), follow the road and the statue is at the corner
