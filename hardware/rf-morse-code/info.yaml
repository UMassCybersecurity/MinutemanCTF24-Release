name: The Magicians Code

description: |-
  Angier has a new trick! Borden stole a machine from Angier's workshop that he's 
  sure is the key to understanding the trick. But when he turned it on he couldn't
  figure out how it worked. It just repeated the same pattern over and over again.
  Help Borden find the secret message Angier left in the machine so he can finally
  become the greatest magician.
