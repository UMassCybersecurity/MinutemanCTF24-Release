  I found this cool circuit that unlocks a mysterious door. Can you help me get the right input so I can open the door?
  Use the flag format `MINUTEMAN{input_bits}` for example if all 1s where correct then the flag would be `MINUTEMAN{111111}`. The bits should be in order from top to bottom.

flags:
  - content: "MINUTEMAN{001010}"

hints:
  - content: "This file seems like it can be opened in Logisim Evolution: https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution"
  - content: "If you know propositional logic, try to turn it into a proposition and solve."
  - content: "See if theres a way to analyze the circuit in Logisim."

value: 100
