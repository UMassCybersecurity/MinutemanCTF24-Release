name: Minuteman Signal
description: We are trying to setup a new signaling system to warn our minutemen when the British are coming. We have an Arduino Uno with a LED hooked up to pin 8. Can you write some code to blink the led 5 times a second?

flags:
    - content: MINUTEMAN{nOW_w3_CaN_cOmmuNicATE}

hints:
    - content: Check out ArduinoIDE or PlatformIO to write and compile code for micro-controllers.
    - content: How long do you need to wait before flipping the pin to have it blink 5 times a second. (5Hz means it should take 200 ms to complete 1 cycle)

value: 100
